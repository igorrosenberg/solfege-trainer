None of these worked

Help me understand the data flow. How does the app know the possile packs to play ?

[Request interrupted by user for tool use]Help me understand the data flow. How does the app know the possile clefs to play ? I think there's some setSelectedClef

Could you refactor both clefs into an array ?

I wnt to localize the App. It seems things are written in English. Can you spot all these ?

yes

The image names have a convention. tell me which

Using convention "{clef} {note} {number}.jpg", modify the answer-area. I want to display
span{note} span(number)
give classes to these spans.

Use CSS as you suggest. Don't forget to add some padding

Can I export this onto a simple http server ?

Oh no. The dist folder contains root links, for example /assets/index-5xIn8wVk.js
make these relative please !

Oh no, the json files also have incorrect paths

what is the build command to produce a dist fodler ?

oh no, loading the json has the same problem !

Listen : the code to load the json uses a fetch. It should use a relative path too

save all my input to the conversation in @instructions.2.txt
